5. Explain the client-server architecture of the web with a neat diagram? 
Ans. A client is usually a web browser like Chrome or Firefox that is used by the user to request information.
When a user types a website address or clicks a link, the client sends a request to the server using HTTP/HTTPS.
                       Client (Browser)  ---- HTTP Request ---->  Web Server
                       Client (Browser)  <--- HTTP Response ----  Web Server

6.Describe the functions of the following Internet services: Email, FTP, and VoIP.
Ans. The function of the following are:
     - E-mail : It is used to send and receive messages text and file attachments over the Internet SNMP is used for sending the message and POP 3 or IMAP is used for retrieving the message.
     - FTP : It is used to transfer files between computer over the network.
     - Voip : It is A technology which allows voice communication over the Internet it converts voice signals into digital data packets And back into the analog signal before it reaches the destination.


7."The Internet is a network of networks." Elaborate on this statement explaining how packet switching works.
Ans. The Internet is called a network of networks because it is not a single network. Instead, it is a global system made by connecting thousands of smaller networks (like LANs, WANs, ISPs, and private networks) so that devices worldwide can communicate with each other.Each network can have its own hardware, protocols, and administration, but they all follow common Internet standards (TCP/IP) to communicate. Example: Your home network connects to your ISP’s network, which connects to other ISPs, universities, or corporate networks, forming the Internet.

8. A startup company wants to host a website that displays the same information to all visitors and requires very low maintenance costs. However, they are being advised to use a dynamic website. As a consultant, would you agree? Justify your answer.
Ans. 

9. A user types www.google.com into their browser, but the browser displays a ”Server Not Found” error, even though the internet connection is active. However, accessing the site via 142.250.190.46 works. Diagnose the problem and explain the underlying technology that failed.
Ans. The problem occurs due to the failure of the Domain Name System(DNS). DNS is the INternet service that translate human readable domain names such as www.google.com into numerical  IP addresses like
142.250.190.46, which computers uses to locate servers on the Internet. When the user types www.google.com, the browser sends a DNS request to a DNS server to find the corresponding IP address. In this case, 
the DNS server fails to respond correctly or cannot resolve the domain name, resulting in a "Server Not Found" error. However, when the user directly enters the IP address 142.250.190.46, the browser bypasses 
the DNS lookup process and connnects directly to Google's server. This cofirms that  the Internet connection and the web server are working properly. Therefore, the underlying technology that failed is the Domain Name System(DNS),
not the Internet connection or the web server.
