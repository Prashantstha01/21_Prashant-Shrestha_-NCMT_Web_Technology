### Group B: Long Questions (4 Marks)

#### 5. Explain the client-server architecture of the web with a neat diagram.
**Ans:**  
A client is usually a web browser like Chrome or Firefox that is used by the user to request information.  
When a user types a website address or clicks a link, the client sends a request to the server using HTTP/HTTPS.


#### 6. Describe the functions of the following Internet services: Email, FTP, and VoIP.
**Ans:** The functions of the following are:

- **E-mail:**  
  Used to send and receive text messages and file attachments over the Internet. SMTP is used for sending messages, while POP3 or IMAP is used for retrieving them.

- **FTP:**  
  Used to transfer files between computers over a network.

- **VoIP:**  
  A technology that allows voice communication over the Internet by converting voice signals into digital data packets and then back to audio at the destination.

#### 7. “The Internet is a network of networks.” Elaborate on this statement.
**Ans:**  
The Internet is called a network of networks because it is not a single network. Instead, it is a global system formed by connecting thousands of smaller networks such as LANs, WANs, ISPs, and private networks so that devices worldwide can communicate with each other.  
Each network may have its own hardware, protocols, and administration, but they all follow common Internet standards (TCP/IP) to communicate.

### Group C: Scenario-Based Questions (5 Marks)

#### 8. A startup company wants to host a website that displays the same information to all visitors and requires very low maintenance costs. Should they use a dynamic website?
**Ans:**  
No. A static website is more suitable because it is simple, cost-effective, easy to maintain, faster, and more secure.  
Dynamic websites are only needed when content must change frequently or be personalized.

#### 9. Why does `www.google.com` fail but `142.250.190.46` works?
**Ans:**  
This problem is caused by failure of the **Domain Name System (DNS)**. DNS translates domain names into IP addresses. Since the IP address works but the domain name does not, the DNS service has failed, not the Internet connection or the server.

#### 10. Which network type should be used to share sensitive inventory data with suppliers?
**Ans:**  
The corporation should implement an **Extranet**. It allows secure, controlled access for selected external users such as suppliers without exposing information to the public.
